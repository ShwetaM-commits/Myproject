# Myproject

The goal of this project is to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model that personalizes offers and rewards for Google Pay (GPay) users based on their transaction history and behavioral patterns. The model predicts the likelihood of a user redeeming a particular offer (target variable: ‘Last_Offer_Redeemed’) and recommends customized deals to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.
